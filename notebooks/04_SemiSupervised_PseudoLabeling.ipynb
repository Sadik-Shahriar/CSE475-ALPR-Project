    "# **CSE 475: Semi-Supervised Object Detection (Pseudo-Labeling)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Objective**\n",
    "This notebook implements **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** for object detection, specifically focusing on License Plate Recognition. This project evaluates how unlabeled data can improve object detection performance using the **Pseudo-Labeling** technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Tasks:**\n",
    "1.  **Unlabeled Data Simulation:** Simulate a data-scarce environment by hiding labels for **80%** of the training data, retaining only **20%** as labeled.\n",
    "2.  **Baseline Training:** Train a **YOLOv12** backbone on the limited (20%) labeled subset to establish a baseline performance.\n",
    "3.  **Pseudo-Labeling (Teacher-Student Loop):**\n",
    "    * Use the baseline model (Teacher) to predict labels on the 80% unlabeled data.\n",
    "    * Filter predictions based on a high confidence threshold.\n",
    "    * Combine original labeled data with the new \"pseudo-labeled\" data.\n",
    "4.  **Retraining:** Train a final model (Student) on this combined dataset.\n",
    "5.  **Comparison:** Evaluate the performance gain (`mAP@0.5` and `mAP@0.5:0.95`) achieved by the Semi-Supervised model against the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Dataset Overview**\n",
    "The project utilizes the **License Plate Recognition Dataset** hosted on Roboflow Universe. This dataset is designed for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems and supports single-class detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class:** `0 -> License Plate`\n",
    "* **Format:** YOLO format (`<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`)\n",
    "* **Diversity:** The dataset includes images of cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks captured in diverse environments (streets, parking lots, highways).\n",
    "* **Challenges:** The data includes challenging real-world scenarios such as motion blur, nighttime visibility, sun glare, and partial occlusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Distribution**\n",
    "The original dataset is split as follows:\n",
    "* **🟢 Train:** 7,057 images\n",
    "* **🔵 Validate:** 2,048 images\n",
    "* **🟠 Test:** 1,020 images\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Experimental Split (Unlabeled Simulation)**\n",
    "To adhere to the assignment constraints and simulate a semi-supervised learning scenario, the **Train** set (7,057 images) is randomly split as follows:\n",
    "* **Labeled Set (20%):** **~1,411 images**. Used for training the baseline model and initial supervision.\n",
    "* **Unlabeled Set (80%):** **~5,646 images**. Labels are discarded/hidden. These images are used for the Pseudo-Labeling inference step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Baseline Detector Summary**\n",
    "* **Model Architecture:** YOLOv12n (Nano) - Ultralytics\n",
    "* **Reason for Selection:** This was the best-performing object detector from **Assignment 1**, chosen for its high accuracy (mAP) and ultra-fast inference speed suitable for real-time ANPR on edge devices.\n",
    "* **Assignment 1 Performance:**\n",
    "    * **Backbone:** YOLOv12n (csp-darknet)\n",
    "    * **Previous mAP:** `mAP@0.5`: 0.9765 | `mAP@0.5:0.95`: 0.7307\n",
